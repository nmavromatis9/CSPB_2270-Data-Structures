# Hash Table
In this assignment you will implement a Hash Table

Project has following folder tree

CMakeLists.txt      : Ignore this file  
CMakeLists.txt.in   : Ignore this file  
README.md           : Readme file  
app\                : Application folder  
main.cpp            : Application main file for your personal tests. you can use this executable to debug your own classes.  
build\              : Build folder to build the project. your executables are gonna be here eventually.  
code\               : all your code should be in this folder.   
Hash.cpp           : Hash class source file  
Hash.h             : Hash class heather file  
tests\              : Tests folder  
test_Hash.cpp      : Tests implemented for you / your personal tests  



For your final submission you submitt Hash.cpp and Hash.h files. Any other changes in other folders will be ignored in grading process but feel free to change them if you want to test/debug something.

## Where to Start
Open a terminal window in Jupytherhub(recommended) or your personal linux/mac machine (no windows platforms). First pull the this repository by
```console
jovyan@jupyter-yourcuid:~$ git clone https://github.com/Colorado-CompSci-Ugrad/Hash.git
```
### If you want to use vscode environment
Then open the VScode app through JupyterHub and open Hash folder from vscode.

Now your environment is set up, change Hash.cpp and Hash.h files and eventually press CTRL+SHIFT+B to compile your code.

Open a terminal window in vscode and go into ''build'' folder and run tests by
```console
jovyan@jupyter-yourcuid:~$ ./run_tests
```
debugger is also set up for you, go to debug tab on the left column and select **Run Tests** in drop-down menu and press the green play button to run the debugger. if you have any implementation in **app/main.cpp** you can also debug that code by first choosing **Run App** in drop-down menu and pressing green play button.

### If you want to use linux terminal for comilation
Make sure you have the dependecies installed (ckeck dependencies in this document)
go into your project folder, then build folder
```console
jovyan@jupyter-yourcuid:~$ cd Hash
jovyan@jupyter-yourcuid:~$ cd build
```
run cmake to create make file for your project
```console
jovyan@jupyter-yourcuid:~$ cmake ..
```
run make to compile your code
```console
jovyan@jupyter-yourcuid:~$ make
```
once done, you can run tests by 
```console
jovyan@jupyter-yourcuid:~$ ./run_tests
```
app executable is also in this folder, you can run it by
```console
jovyan@jupyter-yourcuid:~$ ./run_app
```
you can debug in terminal using gdb

## Dependencies
you need **gcc** and **cmake** installed to be able to compile this code.

if you are using vscode environment in JupyterHub, you just need to make sure you have C/C++ extension installed.

## About This homework
Check Hash.h file comments for detailed information for each function.
